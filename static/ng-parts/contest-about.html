        The contest mode is a space when the fun begins. You can see the feed of plant requests the FlowerChecker experts deal with in the real time. Here are the rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Correct answer</b> - <span class="green">1 - 100 points</span> according to how fast you are at the scale of 0 to 24 hours.</li>
        <li><b>Partial agreement</b> - <span class="green">1 - 50 points</span>. You basically get half the sum of what would you get if correct. This happens when you write the genus name only but experts manage to identify the species as well. However, if they know the genus only, your answer is considered as correct.</li>
        <li><b>If even experts fail</b> - <span class="green">30 points</span>. Some plants are really tough. Sometimes due to conditions of the plant, sometimes due a bad photo. If we can not tell whether you were right or wrong, you get <span class="green">30 points</span>.</li>
        <li><b>Disagreement with the expert's opinion</b> - <span class="green">0 points</span>. If you disagree, send us an e-mail and we will consider your opinion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Test your skills and and compete with others!
