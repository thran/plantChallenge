    <h3>What is Plant Challenge?</h3>
    <p>PlantChallenge is a brand new service for learning plants. If you have at least a basic knowledge of plants and plant taxonomy, this is the right place to deepen your knowledge. PlantChallenge is for students of botany, gardeners and all plant lovers.</p>
    <p>This is just a beginning. We are currently building a sophisticated and entertaining learning system. It is based on advanced artificial learning models by <a href="http://www.fi.muni.cz/adaptivelearning/" target="_blank">Adaptive Learning Research group</a> from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.muni.cz/?lang=en">Masaryk University</a>, doing cutting edge research on e-learning technology. We are continuously improving both backend (guts) and frontend (skin) of the whole web.</p>
